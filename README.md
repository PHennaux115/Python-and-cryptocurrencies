# Python-And-Cryptocurrencies

(*This project was entierly made thanks to an Udemy course created by Ian Annase ['Python & Cryptocurrency: Build 5 Real World Applications](https://www.udemy.com/coinmarketcap/)' most of the info in this README comes from the course itself*)

In this Python project, I built 5 projects using live cryptocurrency data from the free CoinMarketCap crypto API.

The libraries used in this project are:

- **Prettytables** In order to display data into a table.
- **Colorama** In order to add colors to a table.
- **Requests** In order to request files, in this case JSON files.
- **Datetime** In order to get the date and display it.

With these libraries and the CoinMarketCap API the projects that the course proposed to build are:

1. ***A Cryptocurrency Portfolio App***

    Track all of your crypto assets with ease. See the total value of all your crypto assets combined along with detailed information about each one. Positive and negative values are color coated green and red.

2. ***A Real-Time Price Alert App***

    Get notified when cryptocurrencies hit certain prices in USD. You can keep this program running in the background. Your computer will shout things like, 'Litecoin hit $1200!'.

3. ***A Top 100 Cryptocurreny Ranking App***

    Sort by rank, daily percentage change, or daily volume. Positive and negative values are color coated green and red.

4. ***Predict The Future Values of the Top 100 Cryptocurrencies***

    Explore what the price of cryptocurrencies will be if the global market cap hits certain levels (such as world stock market levels)

5. ***Store Real-Time Information on 1000 Cryptocurrencies in Excel using Python***

    Learn to store cryptocurrency information inside of excel workbooks using Python.
